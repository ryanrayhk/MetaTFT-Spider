**How to use this file:**

1. **Save the file** as `test_metatft_getdata.py` (or any name starting with `test_` and ending with `.py`) in your project directory.
2. **Install pytest and pytest-asyncio** if you haven't:
    ```
    pip install pytest pytest-asyncio
    ```
3. **Run the tests** from your terminal in the project directory:
    ```
    pytest
    ```
    or to run only this file:
    ```
    pytest test_metatft_getdata.py
    ```

**What `test_get_match_data_goto_exception` does:**
- It creates a `MetaTFT` instance.
- Mocks all Playwright browser/page objects.
- Forces `page.goto` to raise an exception.
- Calls `get_match_data`.
- Asserts that the result is `None` (as expected when an exception occurs).

You can add more tests in this file using the same pattern.
